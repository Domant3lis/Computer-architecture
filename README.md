# Computer-architecture
All programs are written for x86 DOS machines using Turbo Assembler and DosBox.

There is a handy little script `run.bat` which builds and runs a specified program.

Currently, `HW1_5.asm`, `HW1_15.asm` and `HW1_20.asm` do not work fully, since they cannot parse strings with `$` symbol properly. I may fix them sometime...
